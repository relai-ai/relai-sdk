<h1>Tutorials</h1>

- [Agent Annotation Benchmark](annotation-benchmark.md): Turn annotated simulation runs into reusable benchmarks that drive Maestro config and structure optimization.
- [Persona Set](persona-set.md): Curate and deploy persona collections, then bind them to simulated entry points for richer user context.
- [Mock MCP Server](mock-mcp-server.md): Spin up platform-hosted mock MCP servers so agents can exercise tool calls without hitting production services.
- [Custom Evaluator](custom-evaluator.md): Implement a bespoke `Evaluator` subclass that scores agent outputs with custom logic and metadata requirements.
