<h1 align="left">RELAI: Simulate → Evaluate → Optimize AI Agents</h1>

**RELAI** is an SDK for building **reliable AI agents**. It streamlines the hardest parts of agent development—**simulation**, **evaluation**, and **optimization**—so you can iterate quickly with confidence.

**What you get**

- **Agent Simulation** — Create full/partial environments, define **LLM personas**, mock **MCP** servers & tools, and generate **synthetic data**. Optionally **condition simulation on real samples** to better match production.

- **Agent Evaluation** — Mix **code-based** and **LLM-based** custom evaluators or use **RELAI platform evaluators**. Turn human reviews into **benchmarks** you can re-run.

- **Agent Optimization (Maestro)** — Holistic optimizer that uses evaluator signals & feedback to improve prompts/configs **and** suggest **graph-level** changes. Also selects **best model/tool/graph** based on observed performance.
